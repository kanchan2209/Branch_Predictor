# Branch_Predictor
Simulation of a simple branch predictor with a 2-bit saturating counter

This Code simulates a simple branch predictor with a 2-bit saturating counter. We are provided with a text file containing a trace of branch instructions consisting of the PC at which each branch occurs, and whether the branch is Taken or Not Taken. 
This code evaluates the performance of a 2-bit saturating counter based branch predictor on this trace. The output file indicates, for each branch in the trace, whether it was predicted as Taken or Not Taken.
